    "My first coding experience was creating a matrix rain inside a console terminal pretending to be a hacker when I was 11 years old.\
    Ever since then, anything and everything computer related has found its way into my heart.\n\
    I’ve studied at the University in Split, earning myself a Bachelors degree with a deans recognition for the best student in my major, which I’m extremely proud of.\n\
    I fell in love with designing and building websites and user interfaces in college when I had my first Web development class, and the rest, is history...\n\
    I am eager to learn more about web development and I’m currently looking for a junior Frontend developer position to finally kick start my career and learn among professionals.\n\
    When I’m not designing or coding, I’m most likely reading, running or working out, creating music or just simply hanging out with the people I love.",
