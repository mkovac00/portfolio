# Portfolio website

My own Portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills and telling the world a little bit about myself.  
Designed in Figma by me and coded fully and solely by me.

# Description

### Technologies used

Technologies I used to build this portfolio are **Figma** for designing the website, **React** as a library of choice for the UI paired with **TypeScript** and **Sass**.

### Design choices

Before building the porftolio I've thought a lot about what **design** to use and somehow I've landed on the whole **"Newspaper vibe"** thing. I felt it to be simple enough not to over clutter the website while also provoking some sort of **unique** design choices not seen around everywhere on every portfolio today.  
I tried to keep it simple yet nice looking giving you that **old school** newspaper reading vibe.
